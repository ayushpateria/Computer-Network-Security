Breaking Vigenere Cipher
In this republic day special assignment, you will break a text in Vigenere cipher. The text is below.

Please see chapter 3 of the notes from David Kohel (available from http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~kohel/tch/M2-CryptoSymetrique/crypto.pdf) on techniques to break Vigenere cipher. You are also free to look up other resources and/or discuss with others for techniques. But the implementation and actual breaking of the cipher must be done by you alone. You are not allowed use tools by anyone else to break this. All the work must be your own.

Your submission must include the decrypted text, as well as a detailed write up on your method that you used to break the encryption.
